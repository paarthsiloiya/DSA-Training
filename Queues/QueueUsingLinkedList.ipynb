    "# **Queue Using Linked List**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. While we can implement queues using arrays, implementing them using linked lists provides dynamic size allocation and eliminates the memory wastage problem that occurs with simple array implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- FIFO (First In First Out) ordering\n",
    "- Dynamic size (grows and shrinks as needed)\n",
    "- Elements are added at rear and removed from front\n",
    "- No fixed size limit (memory dependent)\n",
    "- Efficient memory utilization with no wastage\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Operations:**\n",
    "- **Enqueue**: Add an element to the rear of the queue (insert at tail)\n",
    "- **Dequeue**: Remove and return the front element from the queue (delete from head)\n",
    "- **Front/Peek**: View the front element without removing it\n",
    "- **Rear**: View the rear element without removing it\n",
    "- **isEmpty**: Check if the queue is empty\n",
    "- **Size**: Get the number of elements in the queue"
