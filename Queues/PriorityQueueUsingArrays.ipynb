    "# **Priority Queue Using Arrays**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Priority Queue is an abstract data type where each element has an associated priority value. Elements are served based on their priority rather than their insertion order. Higher priority elements are dequeued before lower priority elements, regardless of when they were added.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- Elements have associated priority values\n",
    "- Higher priority elements are served first\n",
    "- Same priority elements follow FIFO order\n",
    "- Can be implemented using arrays, heaps, or linked lists\n",
    "- Essential for many algorithms (Dijkstra's, A*, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Priority Queues:**\n",
    "- **Max Priority Queue**: Higher numeric priority = higher actual priority\n",
    "- **Min Priority Queue**: Lower numeric priority = higher actual priority\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure of a Priority Queue:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Element: [Data, Priority]\n",
    "Queue: [[Task1,3], [Task2,1], [Task3,5], [Task4,2]]\n",
    "After sorting by priority (Max): [[Task3,5], [Task1,3], [Task4,2], [Task2,1]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Operations:**\n",
    "- **Enqueue/Insert**: Add an element with priority\n",
    "- **Dequeue/ExtractMax**: Remove and return highest priority element\n",
    "- **Peek/Top**: View highest priority element without removing it\n",
    "- **ChangePriority**: Modify priority of an element\n",
    "- **isEmpty**: Check if queue is empty\n",
    "- **Size**: Get number of elements"
