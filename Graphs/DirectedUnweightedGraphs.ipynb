    "# **Directed Unweighted Graphs - Complete Guide**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Directed Unweighted Graph** (also called a **Digraph**) is a collection of vertices (nodes) connected by directed edges where edges have a specific direction but no associated weight. This means if there's an edge from vertex A to vertex B, you can only travel from A to B, not necessarily from B to A.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Vertices (Nodes)**: Individual points or entities in the graph\n",
    "- **Directed Edges**: Connections with a specific direction (A → B)\n",
    "- **Asymmetric Relations**: Edge (u,v) does NOT imply edge (v,u) exists\n",
    "- **In-degree**: Number of edges pointing into a vertex\n",
    "- **Out-degree**: Number of edges pointing out from a vertex\n",
    "- **Path**: Sequence of vertices following edge directions\n",
    "- **Cycle**: Directed path that starts and ends at the same vertex\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graph Terminology:**\n",
    "- **Source Vertex**: Vertex with in-degree = 0 (no incoming edges)\n",
    "- **Sink Vertex**: Vertex with out-degree = 0 (no outgoing edges)\n",
    "- **Strongly Connected**: Path exists between every ordered pair of vertices\n",
    "- **Weakly Connected**: Underlying undirected graph is connected\n",
    "- **Topological Order**: Linear ordering respecting all edge directions\n",
    "- **Strongly Connected Components (SCCs)**: Maximal strongly connected subgraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications:**\n",
    "- **Task Scheduling**: Dependencies between tasks, project management\n",
    "- **Web Pages**: Link structure, PageRank algorithm\n",
    "- **Social Networks**: Following relationships, influence propagation  \n",
    "- **Compiler Design**: Control flow graphs, dependency analysis\n",
    "- **Transportation**: One-way streets, flight connections\n",
    "- **Biology**: Gene regulation networks, food webs"

    "## Node Definition for Directed Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Node (Vertex)** in a directed graph represents an entity that can have incoming and outgoing connections. Each node maintains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Node Identity**: Unique identifier (name, number, etc.)\n",
    "- **Incoming Edges**: Other nodes that point to this node\n",
    "- **Outgoing Edges**: Nodes that this node points to\n",
    "- **Traversal State**: Visited status, discovery/finish times, colors (for algorithms)\n",
    "\n",
    "In directed graphs, we need to carefully track edge directions since the relationship between nodes is asymmetric. We'll represent nodes as simple identifiers and manage their directed connections through graph data structures."
