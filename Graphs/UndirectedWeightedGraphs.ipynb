    "An **Undirected Weighted Graph** is a collection of vertices (nodes) connected by edges where each edge has an associated weight/cost and no direction. This means if there's an edge between vertex A and vertex B with weight W, you can travel from A to B and also from B to A with the same weight W.\n",

    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Vertices (Nodes)**: Individual points or entities in the graph\n",
