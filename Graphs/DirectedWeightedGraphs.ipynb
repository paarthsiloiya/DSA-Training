    "# **Directed Weighted Graphs - Complete Guide**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Directed Weighted Graph** (also called a **Weighted Digraph**) is a collection of vertices (nodes) connected by directed edges where each edge has both a specific direction and an associated weight (cost, distance, capacity, etc.). This combines the directional constraints of directed graphs with the quantitative relationships of weighted graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Vertices (Nodes)**: Individual points or entities in the graph\n",
    "- **Directed Weighted Edges**: Connections with specific direction and numerical weight (u → v, weight w)\n",
    "- **Asymmetric Relations**: Edge (u,v) with weight w₁ does NOT imply edge (v,u) exists or has weight w₁\n",
    "- **Edge Weights**: Represent costs, distances, capacities, probabilities, or any measurable relationship\n",
    "- **Path Weight**: Sum of all edge weights along a path\n",
    "- **Shortest Path**: Path with minimum total weight (not necessarily minimum hops)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graph Terminology:**\n",
    "- **Weighted In-degree**: Sum of weights of incoming edges\n",
    "- **Weighted Out-degree**: Sum of weights of outgoing edges\n",
    "- **Shortest Path Distance**: Minimum weight path between two vertices\n",
    "- **Negative Edge Weights**: Can create negative cycles and complicate shortest path algorithms\n",
    "- **All-Pairs Shortest Paths**: Shortest distances between every pair of vertices\n",
    "- **Minimum Spanning Arborescence**: Directed version of MST (rooted at a specific vertex)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Representation:**\n",
    "- **Graph G = (V, E, W)** where V is vertices, E is directed edges, W is weight function\n",
    "- **Weight Function**: W: E → ℝ (maps each edge to a real number)\n",
    "- **Path Weight**: w(p) = Σ w(eᵢ) for all edges eᵢ in path p\n",
    "- **Distance**: δ(u,v) = min{w(p) : p is a path from u to v}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications:**\n",
    "- **Transportation Networks**: Flight routes with costs, road networks with travel times\n",
    "- **Computer Networks**: Routing protocols with latency/bandwidth considerations\n",
    "- **Project Management**: Task dependencies with durations and costs\n",
    "- **Financial Systems**: Currency exchange rates, transaction costs\n",
    "- **Social Networks**: Influence strength, relationship weights\n",
    "- **Supply Chain**: Logistics costs, delivery times, capacity constraints\n",
    "- **Game Theory**: Decision trees with payoffs, strategy costs\n",
    "- **Resource Allocation**: Optimization problems with weighted constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weight Interpretation Examples:**\n",
    "- **Distance**: GPS navigation, shortest route planning\n",
    "- **Time**: Scheduling algorithms, critical path analysis\n",
    "- **Cost**: Economic optimization, budget allocation\n",
    "- **Capacity**: Network flow, resource management\n",
    "- **Probability**: Markov chains, probabilistic models\n",
    "- **Energy**: Power grid optimization, circuit analysis\n",

    "## Node Definition for Directed Weighted Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Node (Vertex)** in a directed weighted graph represents an entity with directional relationships. Each node can have different incoming and outgoing connections with associated weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "In directed weighted graphs, we need to store:\n",
    "- **Node Identity**: Unique identifier (name, number, etc.)\n",
    "- **Outgoing Edges**: Nodes this vertex points to with weights\n",
    "- **Incoming Edges**: Nodes that point to this vertex with weights  \n",
    "- **Traversal State**: Visited status, distances, parent pointers (for algorithms)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll represent nodes as simple identifiers and manage their directed connections through graph data structures that store both adjacency and weight information while respecting edge directions."
