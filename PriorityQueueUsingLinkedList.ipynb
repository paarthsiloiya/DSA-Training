    "# **Priority Queue Using Linked List**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Priority Queue implemented using Linked Lists provides dynamic size allocation and efficient priority-based operations. Unlike array-based priority queues, this implementation can grow and shrink as needed while maintaining elements in priority order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- Elements have associated priority values\n",
    "- Higher priority elements are served first\n",
    "- Dynamic size - grows and shrinks as needed\n",
    "- No memory wastage or overflow (within system limits)\n",
    "- Maintains priority order through linked structure\n",
    "- Same priority elements follow FIFO order\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Priority Queues:**\n",
    "- **Max Priority Queue**: Higher numeric priority = higher actual priority\n",
    "- **Min Priority Queue**: Lower numeric priority = higher actual priority\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure of a Priority Queue using Linked List:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Head → [Task3,P:5] → [Task1,P:3] → [Task4,P:2] → [Task2,P:1] → NULL\n",
    "       ↑ Highest Priority                      ↑ Lowest Priority\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Operations:**\n",
    "- **Enqueue/Insert**: Add an element with priority (maintain sorted order)\n",
    "- **Dequeue/ExtractMax**: Remove and return highest priority element\n",
    "- **Peek/Top**: View highest priority element without removing it\n",
    "- **Search**: Find an element and return its priority\n",
    "- **ChangePriority**: Modify priority of an element\n",
    "- **isEmpty**: Check if queue is empty\n",
    "- **Size**: Get number of elements"
